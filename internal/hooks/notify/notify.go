// Package notify publishes instance status changes to whatever message broker
// an operator configured with a [notify.<name>] definition. The brokers are notifier
// plugins (plugin.Notifier, registered with plugin.RegisterNotifier; Redis,
// RabbitMQ and MQTT today, another can be added later as its own package under
// plugins/, without touching this package or the runner). BuildConnection selects one
// by the table's "type", and Hook is the runner.EventHook that turns the events
// of an instance into published payloads.
//
// A notifier is compiled into a build only when plugins/all imports it, which
// is behind build tags (redis, rabbitmq, mqtt, notify_all); that keeps a
// broker's client library out of the binary of a build that does not ask for
// it.
