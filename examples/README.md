# Configuration examples

Each file is a self-contained `dnspatch.toml`: copy it, replace the
`CHANGE_ME` placeholders and the `${...}` references, and start the daemon
with `--config`.

| File | Shows |
|------|-------|
| [minimal.toml](minimal.toml) | The smallest working config: one retriever, one provider, one instance. Start here. |
| [dual-stack.toml](dual-stack.toml) | One instance writing both an A and an AAAA record, using two retrievers pinned to `ipv4` and `ipv6`. |
| [family-dual-with-fallback.toml](family-dual-with-fallback.toml) | A retriever whose service is itself dual-stack (`family = "dual"`), plus a fallback chain across further retrievers for the families it does not fill. |
| [interface-ipv6.toml](interface-ipv6.toml) | Reading the IPv6 address from a network interface instead of an external service, with a delegated prefix picked by `network`. |
| [nicru.toml](nicru.toml) | Updating a record at NIC.RU with one request for both addresses; notes the NIC.RU quirk of changing same-name records in every zone of the contract. Other dyndns2 services use `type = "dyndns2"` with a `base_url`. |
| [proxy.toml](proxy.toml) | Reaching a provider's API through a proxy, for a DNS host that only accepts requests from a fixed address. |
| [rfc2136.toml](rfc2136.toml) | Updating a record on your own name server (BIND, Knot, PowerDNS, ...) with RFC 2136 dynamic updates signed with a TSIG key. |
| [secrets-from-files.toml](secrets-from-files.toml) | Reading a secret from a file (`${file:/path}`) instead of an environment variable, the way Docker/Kubernetes secrets are mounted. |
| [multi-provider.toml](multi-provider.toml) | Several instances and providers in one process: two sites, two DNS hosts, independent polling intervals. |
| [full-build.toml](full-build.toml) | The notifiers, which only exist in the full build, next to `ping_url` (a ping on every cycle): `[notify.<name>]` (status changes published to Redis, per instance). |

For the full parameter reference of every plugin see
[parameter reference](https://dnspatch.github.io/dnspatch/PARAMETERS/). The general syntax
(`${NAME}` expansion, `ref` overrides, proxies) is documented in the
[documentation](https://dnspatch.github.io/dnspatch/configuration/).
