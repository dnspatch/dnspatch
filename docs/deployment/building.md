# Building from source

```sh
go install github.com/dnspatch/dnspatch/cmd/dnspatch@latest
```

Requires Go 1.25 or newer. A plain `go build` gives the same daemon as the `dnspatch` image and binaries: every retriever and provider except three heavy ones (`rfc2136`, `yandexcloud` and `namecheap`), the `ping_url` hook, and no notifier backend. To get a smaller binary, or the plugins of the `-full` one, choose what goes in with build tags. This matters where size does: a Raspberry Pi, or a router running OpenWrt.

## Build tags

Every plugin has a build tag named after its type, and there are two more:

- `full` compiles in every plugin, what the `-full` image and binaries are. It wins over `dnspatch_none`.
- `dnspatch_none` leaves out every retriever and provider. Add the tags of the ones you need to bring those back, and nothing else is compiled in.

What a plugin's tag does depends on whether the plain build has the plugin. For a plugin it has, the tag matters only together with `dnspatch_none`. For one it leaves out, the tag adds that plugin to the plain build: `rfc2136`, `yandexcloud` and `namecheap` among the providers, and every notifier backend (`redis`, `rabbitmq`, `mqtt`; see [Notifications](../operations/monitoring.md#notifications)). They are left out because the libraries they need make the binary larger, by 0.1 to 1.5 MB each. The table at the end of this page says which plugin is which, and `ping_url` (see [Monitoring](../operations/monitoring.md#monitoring-pings)) is always there.

```sh
# Only the ipify retriever and the Cloudflare provider.
go build -tags "dnspatch_none,ipify,cloudflare" -ldflags "-s -w" -o dnspatch ./cmd/dnspatch

# Every plugin, what the -full image is.
go build -tags full -o dnspatch ./cmd/dnspatch

# The plain build plus the rfc2136 provider and the redis notifier.
go build -tags "rfc2136,redis" -o dnspatch ./cmd/dnspatch
```

A build that lacks a plugin your configuration names refuses to start and says which tag to add, for example `provider type "cloudflare" is not compiled into this build: rebuild with the "cloudflare" build tag`. Every plugin a configuration uses must be in the build, so the list of tags is easiest to write from the `type` lines of your `dnspatch.toml`. The [config builder](https://dnspatch.github.io/builder/) does this for you: it lists the tags, the Docker image and the build command for the plugins you chose.

## Notes on the tags

- `nicru`, `noip`, `dyn` and `dynu` are `dyndns2` with the update URL filled in, so they share its code, and the type `dyndns2` is registered along with any of them. It costs nothing, since the code is in the binary anyway.
- Expect a saving of a megabyte or two, not a tenfold one: the HTTP and TLS code of the standard library, which nearly every plugin needs, is most of the binary. For `amd64` with `-ldflags "-s -w"`, the plain build is about 7.4 MB, `dnspatch_none,ipify,cloudflare` about 7.1 MB, and the `-full` one about 10.9 MB. Measure the build you care about with `ls -l`.

## Cross-compiling

Cross-compile with `GOOS` and `GOARCH`. Keep `CGO_ENABLED=0`, so that the binary is static.

| Target | Settings |
|--------|----------|
| Raspberry Pi, 64-bit system | `GOARCH=arm64` |
| Raspberry Pi, 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS | `GOARCH=arm GOARM=7` |
| OpenWrt, MediaTek or older Atheros | `GOOS=linux GOARCH=mipsle GOMIPS=softfloat` |
| OpenWrt, big-endian MIPS | `GOOS=linux GOARCH=mips GOMIPS=softfloat` |
| OpenWrt, ARM | `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm` or `arm64` |

`opkg print-architecture` on the router tells which one it is.

## Docker build argument {#docker-build-argument}

The Docker image takes the same tags as a build argument:

```sh
docker build --build-arg TAGS=dnspatch_none,ipify,cloudflare -t dnspatch-mini .
docker build --build-arg TAGS=full -t dnspatch-full .
```

<!-- plugin-tags:end -->

This table is generated by `go generate ./...` from the plugin packages, so it lists what the code has: a plugin added under `plugins/` appears in it, and gets its tag, with no other change.
