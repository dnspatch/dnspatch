# The build stage always runs on the builder's own architecture and
# cross-compiles, so multi-platform images do not need emulation.
#
# The toolchain is newer than the go directive of go.mod on purpose: the binary
# carries the standard library of the compiler that built it, so it has to be a
# release that still gets security fixes. Both base images are pinned by digest
# and Dependabot moves the digests.
